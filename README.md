# Introduction
For more information please refer to the Princeton University Computer Science course 226, entitled 
Algorithms and Data Structures, from Fall 2015: 

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall15/cos226/info.php

and the corresponding MOOC version of this course on Coursera (Algorithms Part I and II):

https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI
https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII

The solutions are written by Ramin Halviatti and kept in this repository for my own reference. 
Each directory corresponds to my solution for the given assignment, and contains the files submitted 
to the Coursera grader for this course.

Additional information and README files for each directory will be provided. Currently test data files are not
included in any of the directories. I will provide the necessary test_data files with instructions on 
how to run each assignment in the README files for each directory.
